I have learned about the different buildings and the different activities that I have the opportunity to attend. My advice is to make sure you check your assignments the very first week from day one to make sure you're doing it and complete it on time because it's very easy in classes, especially STEM classes to get thrown with lots of assignments. My second advice is to also make sure you're asking questions that will be relevant to you, because hiding will not make the professor suddenly just tell you what specific information you need to know, their job is to help you so don't be afraid or scared to ask. The person who gave me the most positive impact was my student orientation leader, he gave me all the information that i could ever need for this college right off the bat which was tremendously helpful for me during the next couple of weeks. The biggest challenge that I have faced was time management because I was doing a lot of class material, club, and events in the college which are very time consuming because homework still needed to be done and other things. My greatest success was being able to at least keep up with work for two of my classes which really helped me in the long run. My experience with UW Whitewater has started off great and I hope my letter gives good advice on how to start classes and this college experience off with a great start. The human condition is the push to achieve equal footing with everyone else around us. Throughout human history we see how people managed to push themselves into getting their freedom and rights, fighting to be treated as equals. We can look in our current world to see how many communities are currently pushing for this. We can see the push done by the black community to be seen as equal as a white man and how they have managed to gain some traction, but still continue to push forward for true equality. We can also look at the homosexual community, as they are currently fighting hard to get equal rights as everyone else. Fighting to get married like everyone else, and to continue to work without fear of retaliation. We can also look into the transgender community as transgender people are currently a big issue today, as people are currently attempting to shut them down and get them to become what they do not want to. They are currently fighting to gain the freedom to choose who they are from schools to the government. We can even look at half of the human population as women are currently being treated as if they are made to be below men. They are currently fighting to get the same respect and valued just as much. By looking at all of these different communities and looking into their struggles to gain equality, we can really see how humans have always pushed for equal rights. Looking at the black community we have seen how this idea connects to the human condition as throughout history they have pushed to gain equality with the white man. In America alone, they have managed to push for their own freedom, finally getting out of serving a white man. From there they have continued to push for true equality, as being free was only one part of it, they continue to push until they get just as much respect and to be valued just as much. They continued to protest to get the right to go to good school, be allowed in the same restroom, and have their lives treated equally as a white man. As Martin Luther king jr has explain his reason to protest “Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of “nobodiness”—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait”, explaining to us that they have to do something or they might never be able to gain the equality they aim for. It shows the struggles they had to deal with having to serve a white man, they wish to get freedom, as Martin Lurther King jr. puts it “Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro”, their aim for all of these protest was to achieve equality in the United States. With time they have managed to have started coming closer to equality, but even in our current era they still continue to fight. We see in the story of Ta-Nehisi Coates, which shows us their current struggles in the unequal system, “In America, the injury is not in being born with darker skin, with fuller lips, with a broader nose, but with everything that happens after”(120), as this passage from his book shows us how they only start to struggle after birth, and how that struggles still exist in our world even after years of protest. In time they have managed to make multiple steps toward this future: removing segregation laws, fighting for higher wages, and getting more representation, but they have yet to achieve true equality. They will keep on pushing forward to achieve true equality for their whole community, to be treated and respected as much as a white man. They are not the only community to achieve massive steps to equality, we can also look to the homosexual community and look at their push to get closer to equality. They have fought hard to be seen as equal from their neighborhood to the military, removing the idea that their lifestyle was an illness. We can look at the United States army and see how far they have come with the treatment of this community. In the past, anyone caught having these types of feelings would be discharged, losing all the benefits they have earned by serving in the army. They would be treated as if they have committed a horrible crime just by loving the same gender. By looking at an interview done by Gautam Raghave, we can clearly see the feared the homosexual community had when serving, “My opportunity to get an education, serve my country, die for my country, if need be – all of that goes away, just because at the time, we didn’t have enough leaders with the courage to say to anyone we are ready and willing to serve and should have the opportunity to do so”, and in the same interview they also mentioned how far they have come. The same people who were in fear of being discharged for being gay, now have gain power to change things for the better. Shalanda Baker was one of those people, once an air force recruiter but got discharged when she came out. She managed to become Secretarial Advisor on Equity and Deputy Director for Energy Justice at the Department of Energy under President Biden. By looking at this example we can see how humanity pushes for equality. The homosexual community did not accept the treatment they were receiving, instead they kept pushed to get more rights, to be treated as equal in this world. We can see how fighting for equality is part of humanity by looking at the biggest group fighting for such equality is females. For generations they are treated as less then men, from their religion to work, they have always been seen as the weaker sex. An example of the oppression women have to face can be seen in stories collected by Susan Kepner, stories from Thai translated to English all having to do with womens. In one of these stories we look into how women are treated in religions, as men are able to escape their family duties to become saints. We can look at one story about a woman who is trying to escape her current life and wants to become a nun. To do this she tries to leave behind her kids, but a cop stops her and starts to question her. From there she explains how the husband has already left them, asking why she could not do the same, he responds by saying “You gave birth to them, then you don't take care of them-think about it”, which shows that the responsibility is with the mother not the father. This story gives an example on how women are treated in the eyes of people, as men are able to leave behind their responsibility, while women are seen as having to stick to their duties. This idea is also seen at Simone Beauvoir’s Second Sex, where she mentions how women had to face with religion constantly casting them down, “The religions invented by men reflect this wish for domination. In the legends of Eve and Pandora men have taken up arms against women. They have made use of philosophy and theology, as the quotations from Aristotle and St Thomas have shown. Since ancient times satirists and moralists have delighted in showing up the weaknesses of women”, a culture created by men making sure that women will be seen as below them. By looking at these ideas we can see how women have been treated as less than males throughout their culture. We can see how in the United States feminism have managed to push for more equality, fighting against the ideals set by the creations of men. They are now able to get positions of power that are above men, having the freedom to go where they want and live life without having to follow the rules placed on them by males. In the past they were not given the same freedoms as males, but they continued to push for more equality. Another community we can look into that is currently in the news, currently for fighting for equality, the transgender community. They are a part of the LGBT+ community, but unlike homosexuals, they have yet to gain very much freedom in the United States. They are currently being forced to act their gender in many schools, looking at an article from The Kansas City we can see how the school forces their ideals on the students, “The school board voted 5-2 to approve the policy, which has sparked ongoing controversy and student protests. It states that students must use the facilities, and participate on the athletic teams, that conform with their sex at birth”, even if they are unconformable multiple school have forced student to be what they are not. This problem is not only happening school, it also goes on within the government as many adults are unable to vote due to their changed gender, “Transgender voters may face questioning or rejection by poll workers because of IDs that don't match their identity, barring them from an important election year for LGBTQ issues”, this shows us how a basic right everyone has in America has been taken from them due to being their preferred gender. Due to all of these problems we have seen multiple protests addressing these issues, fighting against the oppression they currently face to gain their freedom and have the same right as everyone.They will continue fighting for many years to come, as they attempt to achieve the same rights as everyone else, and be valued just the same as everyone. Their current fight is a clear demonstration of how humanity will always strive to be on equal footing as everyone else. By looking at all of these communities, we can see how throughout human human condition is the push to achieve equality. The black community had to face harsh treatments throughout their history, but by continuing to push for equality by protesting and speaking out, they managed to get steps closer to achieving this dream. For the homosexual community they had made large steps forward recently, as they had gotten more right to marry back and in the military since it is no longer an offense to be gay. We can see the current struggles the transgender community have to face. They are currently being forced to act the way they were born and from this we have seen a rise in protest to gain the freedom to be who they want to be. As for the largest community, women have spent most of history being treated as less than men, from their religion to the male view. The current movement of feminism has done a lot to change this dynamic, allowing for women to be seen as valuable as a man, and respected just as much. The goal of all of these communities is to be treated the same and given their freedom just like the majority. It shows us how humanity will always strive to achieve equality. Explain why it is simple and fast to deploy a replica of a container on a new server. Using a replica of a container allows the user to upload and remove them at a very quick rate due to how smaller they are when compared to virtual machines. They also allow independent servers to share an operating system which makes it require less resources.
What are the benefits to software product vendors of delivering software as a service? In what situations might you decide not to deliver software in this way?Name at least two benefits of delivering software as a service, and describe at least one reason why you might decide not to deliver software as a service. Some of the benefits of having software as a service is that it usually means that it will be implemented as a subscription payment, which gives a contained cash flow and allows us the funds to improve the system. A badly received software can be improved and updated, meaning that if people dislike something about the software, you are able to correct it faster for everyone at the same time. Most importantly it allows you easy access to data collection which can be used to improve the software for the user or to create more profit by selling. One large negative of this is that you become dependent on the server, if any issue occurs that leads them to failing, it leads to the user being denied access. Unable to do what they need from us and leaving us they are unable to use the software without the server. Using an example, explain why EU data protection rules can cause difficulties for companies that offer software as a service. Do not simply restate an example from the textbook; come up with an example of your own (although it can be a similar kind of situation.) The issue with EU data protection is it causes companies to slow down their products, as the information you are trying to access is required to be protected in a way that is acceptable to the EU. An example of this can be seen in our own experience with DOU, as it requires us all to stop what we are doing and to pull out our device to confirm it is us trying to get in. At times this takes minutes as the software loads and conforms to the information. As more protection becomes required by the EU, the slower the overall products will become as it has to pass through multiple walls. What are the advantages of using services as the fundamental component in a distributed software system? List at least two advantages. The advantages of this are they are able to be relocated and replicated to multiple different servers, allowing you to easily create backups and provide it to multiple locations. It also allows you to to easily update the software for all users as they are not using it on their own computer, but renting it off of your server. Hey have low coupling so that they do not need to depend on other microservices. By doing it this way you have an easier time running them in parallel instead of having to do it series allowing the overall software to run far faster. As for the high cohesion, it just shows how important it is to have the microservice, if it were low, this would just mean that we are wasting our time using it as only using up resources without providing us much use. When using them both together, we achieve a service that can run in parallel and is used quite often by the software. This allows the software to run far faster with it then without it, and it is also far more efficient scaling up the product. The human condition is the strong will to fight against the system pushing for laws that are just. This whole idea is pushed forward by Martin Luther King Jr. as he was writing a letter addressed to the clergy men and everyone else who criticized what he was doing. In this letter he attempts to reason people who were inconvenient about this protest. He brings up the fact that they have been waiting for years for things to get, as each day is an inconvenience to them, “As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained”. From there he talks about the criticism he receives and talks about the injustice they face, an example he gave was in Birmingham as they had multiple bombing against the black community, and the police were always unable to find a culprit for them. So, they to fight against the system he protested against them having to break laws that he viewed as unjust, “I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws”. All of this was done to fight against the segregation that exist in the current system, writing this a letter to the clergy man is an example of him pushing of this. The letter points a question against them asking them why they have not been helping them push for just laws, “I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation”. He shows us how he much he is willing to do to push for his ideal world, one where people would not be judged by the skin. It also helps to show us the human condition being one where we want to fight for justice and are able to come together, as he did with his community by protesting and how he aims for the church by putting the letter into words that they can understand, referencing the bible and explaining the fact that he is only trying to spread justice. With the church's support things could have changed for the better, as it would have people with white privilege with them and would have made it much harder for police to try anything against their own community. As time passed, we saw how they managed to create a great amount of progress, as he manages to get everyone together to fight for just laws. Throughout this course, I have learned a large amount of information about working in a team in programming. Before taking this course, I only had experience working in pairs, but that paled in comparison to working in a large group. When working in pairs it is much easier to manage time to work together and communication was far quicker, unlike a group environment where everyone had different times they are available making it difficult to get together outside of class hours and communication could take us days. Fortunately before we even started working in a group, this course has provided me with the knowledge of what I should expect in this environment. One of the other things that helped us greatly were scrums. We used our meeting time to talk about what we did prior and planned out what we were going to do next time. Making sure that we are always making a bit of progress. We started off only meeting in our appointment times and created our plan of what we should do for the next meeting. As the deadline got closer, we shifted being far more agile, only really meeting to do some quick update and to figure what needed to get done next. Meetings were moved online so we can focus our time on coding. Another thing that we learned in class that really helped early in development was building EARS. This has been used to help us create the foundation for our software, as it gave us an idea of how the club would use this software and what they would want to gain out of it. An example of this is that we saw the GPS stand out as an important part of the project as they would need to retrieve the data collected from the software. This means that the most valuable part of the software is the ability to not lose the rocket. Another thing that we found out is that we should expect times when some of the sensors will disconnect when it is being used, as the sudden movement could cause issues with the sensor or the wires connecting everything. So we also made one of our focuses to figure out how to best deal with sudden disconnects. Overall a lot of what was taught to us in class has really helped us to stay productive and focus on creating the Rocket Navigator. For this project we did not give out assignments to people, each person just chose what they were going to do before we had our next meeting. For my part in this project I started off being in charge of the reports. For the first report I pushed people into helping write it and making sure we have something to turn at the end. By the end Issac and I worked on the first report. For the second report I made sure to get people to start talking about it right away and I wrote it with Isaac. From there my job changed to helping out with developing the software as we have finally figured out what sensors we were going to focus on. The issue we ran into was that the GPS was out of price range as Nick was paying it out of his own pocket. The fortunate part is Joey had the foundation of the program already designed before we got the parts as we had to wait for shipping, meaning that it was fairly simple to figure out what each section should do once we started to code. Working on the model required me to quickly get used to how things are developed in a raspberry pi and to look more into python programming as I had only basic understanding. At first I focused on learning about each sensor and looked into their libraries, reading their documentation. After this I would look for what would get data we needed from each sensor, and make it so the program would return this information when called. This was much harder than I had expected, the issue I mainly ran into was that I did not fully know if it would work, we did not get the parts until a few weeks before it was due and testing has not been done until the final days. What this meant is that I had no way of knowing if my code would work for the longest time. We attempted to deal with this by just coding in our own system, but the Raspberry Pi libraries would not work in a normal environment, it required us to connect it to a Pi. What Joey did for the moment was create a virtual environment that simulated a raspberry pi and connected to it when coding this software, this allowed us to use the library. This came with its own set of issues as it was an environment that had no pins, which meant that there was no voltage to read. This meant that testing was still not possible for us. For the whole project we just had to program the best we can and hope it would run without any issues during the presentation. Overall, I felt like I contributed a lot to this project, at the beginning I was the one who pushed for the reports. The programming side of things, I spent most of my time looking into the documentation of the sensors and implementing them into our model. As stated before we had no way of testing, the only choice I had was to make sure that the code I wrote would work for each sensor in theory. Due to my own inexperience with Raspberry Pi, I was never confident enough to say that the model will run with minimum errors. It was the main reason it felt like I had nothing to report each week, as I just kept reading the documentation for the sensors, understanding enough to make a guess that would give us the data from each. At the end I also helped to start the view model which would open a file called data.csv and add to it each time it is called. It can also print out the information into a console as well. This came ahead on the day before the final, as we finally had time to test, but we ran into multiple errors with our code. Nick had the team gather up to fix up the mistakes as soon as possible. It was bad timing on my part as I was fully booked that day due to finals and work, so I was unable to help with the final step of the project.
Overall even with all of these feelings, I really feel like this project has really helped me to experience something I would never have in any other classes. In the workforce there will be moments where I will have to continue to code without having the ability to rely on testing as I do currently. In other classes I had never had to write anything that did not allow me to test right away, so losing that ability has forced me to realize that I need to focus on the quality of my code and made me focus on cleaning all the mistakes I have made. I needed to make sure they work in theory so when testing does come around it is more likely to succeed. Another thing that I got to experience was team management and different styles of working in a group. When we first started we would always meet up to discuss all we knew about raspberry pi and rockets. Focusing on learning about the software we were going to build for and our timeline for the semester. From there we started to split up and meet more online once we reached the coding section. We focused on talking about what we have done and what we will do next. It really gave an outlook of how important it is to adapt to different situations, as there are days some people could not make it, resulting in us to adapt to make sure we are on track to finish. It also allowed me to improve my own communications as it became important to know what people are doing and to understand what they expect from you.Python is like no other language, it gives the user multiple options without having to do much. In python you do not put in brackets and you do not have to state what type of variable an object is. As long as everything is written in the correct style, python will be able to understand what you are trying to do. This and many more things makes a fairly easy program to learn and understand. For most people, it is an amazing language to use if you are not planning a future in coding, as it allows you to translate normal writing into code. Focusing mostly on organization rather than requiring the need of curly brackets or something similar to it. It is no wonder that python has increasingly become popular as it allows its users so much more freedom when compared to other languages. As stated before, one of the aspects that makes python easy to learn is the idea that the code does not let you set up a ton of things. In java for example, to know what is in a method, the program requires you to have curly brackets. This allows it to know what is in the method and what is not, so in the end it does not matter how your code is structured. It does not look how spaced out your writing is, or if it is indented, all that matters is if everything is enclosed and done per line. While python on the other hand does not require any of that, they focus far more on your writing. It checks whether or not the code is indent, if there's a line space between them, and how far it is from the main code. Doing this allows you to ignore a ton of requirements java puts and forces a programmer to make their program more legible. Overall python is easier because it is easier to understand when compared to Java or C++ due to the fact that it is far readable. The thing that makes the python hard to understand is the way it requires you to keep everything organized. As a first language, this aspect of python is really easy to understand and it allows users to clearly understand what they are doing. As for learning it later, this aspect of python is what makes learning difficult to get used to. I have seen people struggle to let go of their ideas of how a program should look like, using things that are not needed in python. From java to python, you have to get rid of the idea of needing a comma after every command. Not only that, but you are not able to put as much space as you want in your program. I personally use put a space whenever I call a method or use a loop, as this helps to separate my code into parts and allows me to have an easier time looking back on it. In python you are unable to do this, as putting a space in between code is seen as leaving that part of the code. Most issues tend to get fixed with time, as you slowly start to understand how python wants you to organize your writing, figuring out how to properly do everything. Overall I believe python is not a better choice for a first language, as it gets you used to using shortcuts. It allows people to get into the habit of not needing to close things and not initializing variables. Going from java to python is mostly removing a ton of rules you are used to, as python requires you to ignore what you are used to. On the other hand, going from python to java requires you to add a whole set of rules into your code. I believe that getting used to java or c++ allows you to get more acquainted with rules in programming, it makes sure you get used to them and understand why it is needed. Once you do understand them, it can help to learn languages with a different set of rules, or ones without as many rules. Going the other way around only makes it harder to learn languages with rules, as you become accustomed to not closing your loop or calling out what type of variable an object is. It gets the user used to ignoring vital information needed to run the program. I see The Little Schemer as an amazing example of a teaching tool done right. Throughout the whole book it slowly shows you different concepts and it really explains what is going on with that part of the program. The way it is formatted is also amazing, having everything in two columns, having the left side be the code while the right has information. It is a really helpful tool for learning basic programming concepts, and it should be the standard for teaching most if not all programs. The thing that made the book very helpful is how much information they gave without feeling overwhelmed. From there he slowly builds up the complexity of each program, slowly getting us to understand the scheme more and more. It allows the reader to slowly understand the programmer getting to see an example of what he wants us to remember. How to Design Programs does something similar, giving us a bit of code at a time and really explains their purpose. Getting us to understand the main concept, then giving us code followed up with an explanation of the code. It is not as well done as The Little Schemer, as it is not as well formatted. It does things like a normal text, but one thing it does amazingly is giving links throughout the website. If you ever get confused on a part, you can click on it and it will move you to a page explaining more about that part. This really helps readers to find help right away instead of having to look back and wasting time trying to find the information. Overall, both of these methods are far better than the current standard of teaching a new language. It helps readers to understand things whenever they start to get confused and this type of teaching should be the standard teaching a new language as it is very beneficial to the readers. The approach of The Little Schemer and How to Design Programs would have greatly helped when I first started to learn Java, as it would help guide me outside of the classroom. What these books do is basically like having a teacher guiding you through the whole process, unlike the current books where they just tell us all about the concept and then show the code as an example. For me this type of learning is far too much for one sitting, if you get slightly confused you get stuck unable to understand the rest of the code. It also really would have helped me whenever I got stuck outside of class, as both of these are designed as if a teacher is there giving you helpful advice. So for me a book that slowly guided me through the process, and helping me out whenever I start to get confused would have been a far better resource then the current standard being used. Tyler, age 43, a high school teacher for Dave’s Highschool and interested in building simple electronic systems. Recently divorced, they started focusing all of their time on their job to escape from their current situation. They are currently focusing on building a simple electronic system to use when teaching their class. Due to this being their interest, they have some base knowledge on this area and spend their time on learning more on the subject. They are able to do a ton of research since they are a science teacher needing them to stay up to date with current breakthroughs and are better at finding accurate sources and processing a ton of information. Currently in class the students are not focusing in class and fall asleep whenever they present information with slides. They are so focused on building this to help get their students interested in class and to ignore their current life situation. As a primary school teacher, I need the iLearn system to have KidsTakePicsis to be integrated so I would not need to set up a teacher and class account. As a student, I need the iLearn system to allow others to comment on each others’ posts so we can feel like a community. As a primary school teacher, I need the iLearn system to have strong moderation so I can make sure the students are not posting inappropriate or stolen. As a student, I need the iLearn system to contain newspaper archives and fishing stories so that we can reminisce about stories related to the fishing communities.The iLearn system shall have KidsTakePicsis integrated into the system. While a post is posted, the iLearn system shall allow others to add a comment on it. When a student attempts to post, the iLearn system shall delay the post until a moderator gives approval. Where the iLearn system contains a wiki, the system shall allow the students to find newspaper archives and stories. An architecture designed to support security may be based on either a centralized model, where all sensitive information is stored in one secure place, or a distributed model, where information is spread around and stored in many different places. Suggest one advantage and one disadvantage of each approach. Using a centralized model allows the system to add multiple layers on one area and make sure this is protected as much as possible. This will make it extremely difficult to break into, allowing all of the information to be highly secure and with all the information in one place it will make it easier to access as users will only have to go to one area. On the other hand, by having everything in one place, the second anyone gets in, they will obtain everything that is contained in the system. We could add multiple layers of security, but the system is only as strong as its weakest link. As someone could have shared their password and allowed an attacker to get into the system. Going with a distributed model will protect us against a breach, as the information is spread around. So a breach will only affect one section of the information, keeping the others safe from the attack. It also leads to attackers having to use more time to break into each different area. A problem with this approach is how it would lower the usability of the system, as people would be required to sign into different areas of the information. This will lead to users being irritated since the system will have to make sure you are allowed to access each piece of information the user requests. For renters, an issue they might have to face is a landlord that does not provide proper repairs and at times only does it after the Tenant has left. This is a safety issue as a house that slowly breaks down increases the risk a tenant will face in their daily life. An example of this is when a set of stars that lead to the entrance of the house start to break apart due to wear and tear and the landlord fails to fix it in a timely manner. This in turn might cause it to break apart while the tenant is using it, leading them to be injured. Another example is failing to maintain a heater when it was written that it would be provided to the tenant. Looking into the Wisconsin statutes, it shows us the duty the landlord has with repairs in their property. In the case of the stars, this is mainly covered by section 3 in the statue, which states “Make all necessary structural repairs.” As for the heater issue, this is also covered in section 2, which states “Keep in a reasonable state of repair all equipment under the landlord's control necessary to supply services that the landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed to furnish to the tenant, such as heat, water, elevator, or air conditioning.” The way this law protects us is by making sure that any place you rent while being properly maintained and not neglected. A neglected house leads to it slowly breaking apart, creating an environment that is a danger to the tenant. Each step they take could lead them to falling to the ground causing them to get injured. Without proper heating, a tenant deals with freezing to death when winter comes around. In Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection deals with issues tenants have with their landlord. Any violation can be reported to them and they will review the complaint. An issue people in Wisconsin have recently faced is ice covering the sidewalk. When walking on iced over sidewalks it could easily lead to you tripping and falling. Falling is a giant risk for yourself and others around you, as it leads to injury and sometimes even death. This is especially true for a sidewalk since you are close to the road and a high speed car will have a hard time to react if you fall in front of them. This is a hazard that endangers a person's health and the more it is ignored, the more the sidewalk becomes covered in ice. This in turn increases the risk when walking over it. It impacts people, as slipping could cause death from falling the wrong way to falling into a high speed vehicle. Best case would be having a minor injury, while the worst case is death. There should be laws to deal with this issue as the sidewalk is an important method of travel. Without any regulations, we might see people ignoring sidewalks, increasing the risk the public would face when trying to get across. Currently in Wisconsin we have statutes regulating the sidewalk when covered by ice and snow. The owner of the property the sidewalk is on is responsible for keeping it cleared of ice and snow. They also have a back up plan in the cases where the owner ignores their responsibility, board of public works is responsible for it instead and sends the cost of doing so to the owner. It also gives the city the power to give fines and punishment to people who ignore their responsibility. Overall I see that these regulations are strong enough without being unreasonable, giving people time to clear their sidewalk but still being able to punish people who completely ignore the issue. It is always a good idea to remind people it is important to clear their sidewalks as soon as they can. It is also important to remind people to watch their steps when they take the risk of walking over ice and to stay focused on keeping themselves balanced to decrease the danger. Ignoring this increases the risk of injury and death.
